This is an attempt of a server-side implementation of the non-standard (and mostly undocumented) RTMP Video streaming protocol as used in the flashplayer.

### Project status: ###

### This is pre-beta software. Most probably it simply won't work for you, it also might behave in an unexpected way and destroy your hard disk or even poison your cat. Under very rare circumstances you might get it partially to work without disastrous side effects. You have been warned. Good luck ... ###

If you are more interested in technical features and current development, take a look at the wiki and the actual source code, the worst which can happen, is that you get infected with the erlyvideo virus. Three serious cases have been reported so far, with geographic distribution from US to Brazil to Thailand.
